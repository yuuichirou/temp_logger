The content of the microcontroller flash memory for temp-logger project.

This device displays the current temperature measured in many places,
and archives the results of the measurements.The temperature is measured
by the Dallas DS18B20 sensors. The results are displayed on the alphanumeric
display compatible with the HD44780 controller.

The source code is tested on ATMEL microcontroller ATMega8, 2x16 character
LCD display.

When there is a problem with accessing to the parallel port by AVRDUDE,
add user to lp group.
"sudo adduser <your_login> lp"
